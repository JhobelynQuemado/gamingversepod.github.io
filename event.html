    <h2>Our Events</h2>
    <h3>As a new journey as a Grade 10 student commences, the start of the first quarter is pretty thrilling. We all came together as Group 8 for Lifelabs and with other classes as well, so we got right to it full of excitement and eagerness. In Lifelabs, we completed a brief quiz on how various roles fit in a group during our EG 1 and continued the EG by conducting a basic research on the various streaming platforms and streaming content types during our EG 2. We then performed a survey on 32 students for our chosen content type and the responses of each respondent during EG 3–4. In EG 5–6, we ascertain the needs of the audience, such as our selected streaming content type which is Podcasts—and selected streaming service or platform which is YouTube.  We are now currently on the final Experience Guide of Quarter 1, which is EG 7. We are now constructing our website to commemorate our journey and lessons learned throughout the 1st Quarter. We may have experienced a lot of challenges and obstacles during our 1st Quarter such as uncooperative group mates which is a big disadvantage when it comes to doing group activities, but we are able to be this far and we are able to make progress during our 1st Quarter. In the next Quarters, a fresh obstacle stands in our way but we are hoping to overcome it as a group and we are hoping to have group mates as well who’ll surely help us with our tasks.</h3>
